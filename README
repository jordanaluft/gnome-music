GNOME Music 3.19.90 Alpha
========================

Music is the new GNOME music playing application.


=== Where can I find more? ===

We have a wiki page at
https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Music

You can join us on the IRC:
#gnome-music on GIMPNet


=== Building from jhbuild ===

Follow the BuildGnome tutorial for newcomers at https://wiki.gnome.org/Newcomers/BuildGnome

After installing jhbuild, you have to build gnome-music and all its dependencies. The task can be done by simply running:
$ jhbuild sysdeps --install gnome-music
$ jhbuild build gnome-music

Finally, start gnome music with:
$ jhbuild run gnome-music

=== Troubleshooting ===

Jhbuild fires import errors for python packages like:
"ImportError: /opt/gnome/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/"
Do:
 $ jhbuild shell
 $ export PYTHONPATH=/opt/gnome/lib/python3.3/site-packages:/opt/gnome/lib64/python3.3/site-packages
 $ gnome-music
